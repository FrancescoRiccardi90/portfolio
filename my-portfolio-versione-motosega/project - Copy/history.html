    <p>The first settlements in the area (whose name can be traced back to the sun, solarium, 'attic, open place used in
        ancient times to dry grain'), date back to the Bronze Age; these were replaced by the Finished Ligurians,
        Etruscans and Romans, to whom we owe the first attempts to reclaim the territory, later promoted by the
        Benedictine monks.</p>

    <p> Having overcome the deterioration of the early medieval period, characterised by repeated famine, epidemics and
        floods and the consequent depopulation of the place, already in the first half of the eleventh century it was
        under the Estensi seigniory, followed by the Matildea and the annexation to the municipality of Modena.</p>
    <div> <img width="80%" src="./img/panorama.jpg" alt="panorama"></div>
    <p> In the wake of the events of Modena, it was involved in bitter struggles between opposing factions, passing from
        the Estensi to Passerino Bonalcolsi and from these to the Papal state. It came into the possession of the Pio
        family and was governed by them until the end of the 16th century, when the Este family re-established its
        dominion there, transforming it into a marquisate and, in 1636, entrusting its leadership to the noble Campori
        family, who governed it until the abolition of feudal properties desired by Napoleon at the end of the 18th
        century.</p>

         French and Austrian occupations and the definitive collapse of the Este dukedom were followed by the annexation
        to the Kingdom of Italy, characterised by the spread of social protests due to the progressive worsening of the
        workers' living conditions, with the consequent development of the socialist movements, the labour leagues and
        consumer cooperatives. In the historical-architectural heritage stand out: the Boschetti, Casarini and Boccolari
        villas; the churches of San Michele Arcangelo and San Giovanni Battista; the castle called "Rocca Campori"; the
        church of San Pietro, in Limidi; the parish church of San Bartolomeo, in Sozzigalli.
